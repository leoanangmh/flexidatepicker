# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the **FlexiDatepicker** project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
- Taking responsibility, and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes  
- Focusing on what is best for the community, not just ourselves  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces — including the repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and any related communication channels — and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **leoanangmh@gmail.com**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction
**Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.  
**Consequence:** A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning
**Impact:** A pattern of inappropriate behavior or repeated violations.  
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior, such as temporary restriction from interactions within the community.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact:** Continued inappropriate behavior after a warning.  
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from interaction or public communication regarding the project.

### 4. Permanent Ban
